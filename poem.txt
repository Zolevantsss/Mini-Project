sometimes a voice
low tone, even pitch
quiet awareness lush beneath
the rumble of thought
searches me
streams through currents
that bind the medium
I call my self, this body I am
deliberate and awake
voice, my intimate, radiant
passes through and over
beneath and beyond
and from the cell emanates
sent forth and received
by germ of  being, sustained
before named ovum and seed
and as we who name all things disperse
retreating into our extinction
I wander, returned to expanse
androgyne girl, sometimes I dream
everywhere there are owls and flowers
in waves of  light resplendent
the infant child who is all children
skin to skin on my flesh
downy head to sternum pressed
in warm dreamless sleep
as in my mouth an easy darkness rests
where there had been teeth
